The task is to identify specific type of cactus in aerial imagery, for image classificaion best approach 
would be to use deep learning Neural Networks. CNN would be the ideal approach. As each part of the image
would be considered which will be passed on to convolution layers, pooling woud be to perform feature
engineering and RELU is for capping negative calulated values to 0 as pixels cannot be negative. Finally a 
fully developed neural network for prediction. Sigmoid was used as it is a binary classification. I have 
acheived an accuracy of 94% which can be further improved.
